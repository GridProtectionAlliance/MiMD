# MiMD
The Meter Infrastructure Maintenance & Diagnostic, or miMD, application processes configuration and diagnostic files produced by 
Digital Fault Recorders and other substation devices interrogated by [openMIC](/productsDisturbance.asp#MIC).  miMD then issues reports 
on configuration changes and alters users via email on problems that are self-reported by field devices.
